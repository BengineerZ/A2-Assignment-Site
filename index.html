			<h2>Subtheme: Transit-Oriented Development</h2>

			Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) aims to create dense, affordable, and accessible housing near public transit hubs. The MBTA Communities
			Act mandates zoning changes to encourage multi-family housing near transit stations, but resistance from suburban municipalities and affordability
			concerns pose challenges. This report explores the relationship between transit accessibility, housing density, affordability, and socio-economic
			patterns in Greater Boston through a series of visual analyses.

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the current state of Transit Development in Boston?</li>
				<li>How does TOD impact housing supply, density, and affordability in Greater Boston?
					<ol>
						<li>What role does zoning play in promoting or hindering TOD?</li>
						<li>What is the MBTA Communities Act, and how does it promote TOD?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>What are the main challenges and resistance to implementing TOD in Greater Boston?
					<ol>
						<li>Which municipalities are resistant to zoning, and where are they geographically</li>
						<li>How do municipalities with higher-income households approach zoning and TOD?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>How does transit access correlate with population density and housing development?</li>
				<li>What are the socio-economic patterns of TOD in Greater Boston?
					<ol>
						<li>How does the current transit development in Boston relate to racial and socio-economic equity?</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

			Whilst some of these big questions are only partially answered, we hope this report indicates future directions of analysis which could elucidate any of the answers to
			these questions.
