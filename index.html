			<h2>Subtheme: Transit-Oriented Development</h2>

			Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) aims to create dense, affordable, and accessible housing near public transit hubs. The MBTA Communities
			Act mandates zoning changes to encourage multi-family housing near transit stations, but resistance from suburban municipalities and affordability
			concerns pose challenges. This report explores the relationship between transit accessibility, housing density, affordability, and socio-economic
			patterns in Greater Boston through a series of visual analyses.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				<figcaption>
					Overview of the MBTA Rail Transit Network and the Metro Boston Municipalities
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This map displays the MBTA rail network overlaid on Metro Boston municipalities, highlighting the distribution of transit access across the region.
			The MBTA network is dense in central Boston and its immediate surroundings, while suburban areas have more limited coverage, primarily
			through commuter rail. This spatial disparity has implications for housing density and future TOD, with urban cores seeing more concentrated
			development and suburban areas maintaining lower-density residential patterns.

			<figure>
				<img src="IMAGE_FILENAME" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Population of the Metro Boston Municipalities in Relation to the MBTA Rail Lines
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This figure presents the population distribution across the Metro-Boston area, which is then overlayed with the MBTA Rail lines. Once again, this
			overview figure makes apparent the distinct regions of Metro-Boston area, where the inner city of central Boston has the highest population, which
			diminishes towards the outskirts.

			Generally, we see boosts in population count along the MBTA lines. This makes sense, as the commuter rail is designed to ferry workers from the
			wider metro Boston area to the city and back. As a result, the regions surrounding MBTA lines and stations see a population increase.
			
			Although the previous two figures are meant to provide an introduction to the structure of the transit network in and around Boston, as well as the
			overall population distribution, we will see in the following analysis that this distribution of the MBTA network is central to the future of transit-
			oriented development in Boston.

				<figcaption>
					Assigned Minimum Multi-Family Unit Capacity (%) of Total Housing Units as of January 2025 for
					MBTA Transit Communities
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This figure presents the assigned minimum multi-family unit capacity as a percentage of the total housing units (as of January 2025) for MBTA
			Transit Communities (excluding central Boston). Overlayed on top of this are the MBTA Rail Transit Stations.
			
			This data is part of the new multi-family zoning requirements for MBTA communities, as part of a recent swathe of transit-oriented development
			aimed at alleviating the housing crisis in Boston and the surrounding area (MBTA Communities Act). The lack of zoning for multi-family housing is a
			barrier for new housing development in MA. By assigning multi-family housing near MBTA transit stops, local officials hope to improve housing
			availability and reduce housing costs. In addition, local amenities get a boost.
			
			Here, we see that the density and proximity to local MBTA rail transit stops correlates well with the assigned minimum multi-family unit capacity.
			That is to say, local policy makers are choosing to override local zoning laws and impose transit-oriented development on the Metro-Boston
			Municipalities.
			
			To understand how prior zoning has not improved the housing crisis, consider the following plot.

			<figure>
				<img src="IMAGE_FILENAME" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Percentage of Multi-Family Housing Related to the Number of MBTA Transit Stops within the
					Municipality
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This figure is a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the number of MBTA stops in a municipality and the share of multi-family housing.
			
			Municipalities with more MBTA transit stops generally exhibit a very slightly higher proportion of multi-family housing. However, the trend is very
			weak and outliers such as certain commuter rail towns show low multi-family housing shares despite having multiple transit stops. This
			discrepancy highlights the role of (locally governed) restrictive zoning policies in limiting TOD potential. Policy interventions, such as up-zoning
			around these transit nodes, could help align development patterns with transit accessibility.
			
			This raises an important question: how can the new zoning requirements introduced in the MBTA Communities Act improve the current situation
			outlined in the figure above?

			<figure>
				<img src="IMAGE_FILENAME" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					The Proposed Minimum Multi-Family Unit Capacity Related to the Number of MBTA Transit Stops
					Within the Municipality
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This figure shows another scatter plot, this time illustrating the proposed minimum unit capacity, in relation to the number of MBTA Transit Stops
			within the municipality.
			
			Under the MBTA Communities Act, we would see a greatly increased correlated between the amount of new multi-family units and the number of
			MBTA transit stops within each municipality. That is to say, the proposed new zoning laws would work to improve housing availability and
			affordability in areas that need it the most. By balancing housing supply with demand (in relation to the density of close-by MBTA transit stops),
			policy makers hope to alleviate the housing crisis in Boston.
			
			Of course, resting control away from local municipalities and towns with regards to their own zoning is quite controversial, and has led to some
			resistance in certain regions. In particular, eastern municipalities like Milton, Chelsea and Rockport.
			Can we map resistance to TOD?
			
			To do so, we have to understand some key reasons behind why certain municipalities are against the new act. We've already mentioned loss of
			control, where many residents view the act as an overreach of state government. The preservation of small-town character is another major factor,
			where residents worry that increased housing density will alter the aesthetics and character of their community. More concrete factors include
			infrastructure and resource strain, where local roads, schools and transport links may fail to support significant and rapid increases in housing.
			Finally, residents stronger consider their economic and property value concerns. Some worry that adding lots of multi-family housing could reduce
			property values and increase taxes to support expanded services.
			
			We will investigate these factors in the following two figures.

			<figure>
				<img src="IMAGE_FILENAME" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					MBTA Transit Stop/Stations Within Each Metro Boston Municipality
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This figure maps the number of MBTA transit stops/stations within each metro Boston municipality, excluding central Boston.
			
			As expected, the general trend is that there are more transit stops for more central municipalities. Interestingly, for the communities which are
			resistant to the act, we see that they have relatively lower numbers of transit stops. For example, Milton and Chelsea, although very central, have
			reduced transit densities in comparison to neighbouring municipalities. Yet, under the MBTA act, they are treated as 'rapid-transit' communities,
			and are required to undergo significant transit-oriented development.
			
			This helps paint a picture of regions resistant to change - those that are expecting significant change as a direct result of TOD.

				<figcaption>
					Average Percentage of Single Family Households per Municipal Zone Compared with the
					Percentage of High-Earning Households (>$200K)
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			In this figure, we illustrate the average percentage of single family households per municipal zone, compared with the percentage of high-earning
			households (>200k).
			
			Following the previous discussion, we note that municipalities with a high prevalence of single-family zoning also tend to have a greater proportion
			of high-earning households. This lends credence to the notion that wealthy central regions with higher proportions of single-family housing are the
			most likely to resist the Act. In other words, they are most likely to resist changes to the character of their community.
			
			In addition, this suggests that restrictive zoning policies may contribute to socio-economic exclusion, preventing lower-income populations from
			accessing high-opportunity areas with robust transit connections. Reforming zoning laws to allow more multi-family housing could promote
			economic diversity and equitable TOD development.

				<figcaption>
					Residential Development Sales from 2000-2023 in the Boston City Area Highlighted with Proximity
					to MBTA Rail Station
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			In this figure, we map the residential development sales from 2000-2023 in the Boston city area, which are coloured based on proximity (within a
			0.5 mile radius) to an MBTA Rail Station.

			The most active housing markets are clustered around subway lines, particularly the Red, Green, and Orange Lines. Sales activity diminishes
			significantly as distance from transit stations increases. This trend underscores the premium placed on transit accessibility, reinforcing the
			importance of ensuring affordability near key transit hubs to prevent displacement and maintain equity.
			
			This raises the question: How does the current transit development in the Metro-Boston Area relate to racial and socio-economic equity?

			<figure>
				<img src="IMAGE_FILENAME" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Percentage of White Households in Metro Boston Municipalities
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			In this figure we map the percentage of white households across Metro Boston municipalities.
			The racial composition of Metro Boston municipalities varies significantly, with predominantly white suburban areas often exhibiting lower housing
			density and stricter zoning policies. This pattern suggests that historical and systemic zoning practices may have contributed to this discrepancy, and
			limited housing accessibility for non-white communities. Addressing these disparities through equitable zoning and transit policies could foster
			more inclusive growth.

			Although we do not analyse historical zoning practices in this report, this is an interesting area of future work. Instead, we focus on understanding
			current transport equity.

			<figure>
				<img src="IMAGE_FILENAME" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Population Demographic Beakdown of Municipalities with the Highest Non-White Household Populations
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			This figure shows a demographic breakdown of municipalities with the highest percentage of non-white households, as shown in the previous map.
			We focus our analysis on these communities in understanding how equitable the current transport network is, and how this may be affected by
			future TOD under the MBTA communities act.

			<figure>
				<img src="IMAGE_FILENAME" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					MBTA Transit Stop/Stations Within Each Metro Boston Municipality Compared with the Percentage
					of Non-White Households
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			This scatter plot illustrates the percentage of non-white households in relation to the number of MBTA transit stops within each municipality.
			
			MBTA stations are distributed across diverse communities. There doesn't appear to be a strong correlation between the two. As a direction of
			future research, it would be beneficial to extract data for sub-regions of the municipalities. A finer grained analysis of localised communities and
			overall demographics within each municipality could reveal a stronger relationship between historically marginalised communities, and access to
			transport.

			Additionally, gentrification concerns arise in areas where TOD initiatives may drive displacement. Ensuring that TOD projects include affordability
			measures and community protections will be key to fostering equitable transit access. Analysing this aspect of the MBTA communities act is
			another interesting direction of future research.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>This report examines the impact of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) in Greater Boston, focusing on the MBTA Communities Act and its role in
				promoting multi-family housing near transit hubs. Our analysis reveals that while transit access generally correlates with higher population density,
				restrictive zoning policies in suburban municipalities have limited housing development. The MBTA Communities Act seeks to address this by
				mandating zoning reforms, though resistance is strongest in wealthier, predominantly single-family-zoned communities that cite concerns over
				local control, infrastructure strain, and property values. Additionally, while MBTA transit stops serve diverse communities, disparities in housing
				accessibility and affordability persist, with wealthier, predominantly white municipalities maintaining exclusionary zoning practices. Ensuring TOD
				initiatives include affordability measures is crucial to fostering equitable growth. Future research into localised demographic trends, gentrification
				risks, and the long-term effects of TOD policies could provide deeper insights into the impact of zoning reforms on housing access and socio-
				economic mobility. While the MBTA Communities Act represents a significant step toward alleviating Bostonâ€™s housing crisis, its success will
				depend on effective implementation, community buy-in, and policies that balance growth with equity.</p>
